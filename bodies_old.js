Sheon's orbital ring is populated by millions of inhabitants, the vast majority of which are clones. The industries of Sheon are ship building and repair, mining the gas giant, and farming for calories and oxygen.<br>The government is conducted remotely and in public on the Sheon-specific network board; it's pretty friendly and pleasant for citizens, but it's somewhat impenetrable and confusing for outsiders. The two major factions are the liberal Postech faction and the more conservative, Sheon-Prophecy-abiding Pretech faction. Immigration and circularization are hot political topics.<br> There is basically one recognizable city, the outer-circularized orbit, which is the most civilized and cosmopolitan orbit. It includes the university and the closest thing to a spaceport - a collection of purpose-built stations and asteroids that have been mined-out and lived-in long enough that they're basically space stations that host spaceship repair businesses. These are generally more profitable, progressive, and cosmopolitan.<br>The ring around Shen’s gas giant is congested at the best of times. The magnetic field and large number of micro meteors makes traveling the ring hazardous for any ship except specially outfitted Sheon craft.  There are also so many populated habitats and old caches of pretech equipment that Sheon government asks that only cold gas thrusters are used within 1,000 KM of the ring.<br><br>We sold our salvaged nanobots to AJ-111, a Sheon malware researcher. We also brought a group of Itki refugees to Sheon."
